try to get good at using the command line, and ditch file manager stuff!

An advantage to this is the ability to use systems remotely, so not just your
desktop. File Manager(what I am used to) will most likely be slower!

If working on a server the file manager my not even exist!!



Global variables are evil becuase they can mess with variables outside your
functions! This is refering to scope.

In C/C++ with a for/if block, that variable exists inside the block!
Python does not have this function.
